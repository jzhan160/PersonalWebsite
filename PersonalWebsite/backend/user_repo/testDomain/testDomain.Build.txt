Build.txt - Project1Prototype
=============================
To build this solution:
- Start Visual Studio as Administrator
- build HelperComp project (will become your FileMgr component)
- build UsingComp project (will become your TextSearch component)
- build client
The order matters, so building the solution won't work.
You don't  need to register the components as ATL generates
self registering components.
