        <p>
          I'm a computer software developer with 4+ year of experience in
          software development, web applications development, website
          development, mobile application development on android OS platform,
          M&E information management systems development, database development,
          documentation and user manual writer for software solutions. I have
          worked for several major clients such as USAID, UNICEF, FirstRate Inc
          and Group One MCXi.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with
          other developers in my field. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I
          think my favorite stage of a project is working with clients and
          businesses to analyze the projects deeply. As we go through the
          project analysis process, the ideas start to flow and that's always
          the fun part for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a BA in Computer Science from American University of
          Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working as a freelance software and web solutions
          provider and also hold a position as a System Developer at Checchi
          Consulting & Company Inc.
